# Introduction to Malware
### Purpose of the Course

  1. Provide an introduction to different types of malware and its computational formalizations.
  2. Introduce detection methods employed by malware detectors.
  3. Hands-on tools to identify and generate signatures for malware will be provided.

### Project 01
You should parse the attached two applications for their DOS headers and NT headers (including signature, coff header and optional header) and print out their values in a format like (fields name: field value). The codes should be written in C or C++. You can also download the applications at https://github.com/squarekyzhong/project1-3.git

For example, Dos Header has 19 fields, you print like 
1. e_magic: 5A4D
2. e_cblp: 90
3. e_cp: 3
4. e_crlcï¼š0
5. e_cparhdr: 4

Similarly for NT headers.
All values should be in hexadecimal.
You should also download Firefox browser to download the applications because Google Chrome will check it as malicious. https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/
